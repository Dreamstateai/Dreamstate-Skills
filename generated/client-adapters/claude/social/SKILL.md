# Claude Code surface adapter

Use the client-neutral kernel through the Dreamstate MCP core profile. Ask material undiscoverable finite choices with the native structured question tool. Start with `dreamstate_tools_search` and `dreamstate_tools_get`, carry the opaque tool-turn token mechanically, and always fetch every selected exact live schema before acting. `dreamstate_tools_run` is for direct operations the core contract explicitly permits, such as zero-cost validators or canonical reads. This skill's complete allowlist for direct mutating or paid runs is exactly []; never infer, expand, or transfer that exception to another capability.

For any requested mutation or paid effect not named in that exact allowlist, create the complete revision-bound artifact with `dreamstate_proposals_create`. Present that exact proposal for human review; do not claim it ran. Re-read current proposal state with `dreamstate_proposals_get`, then call `dreamstate_proposals_mutate` only on the human's explicit instruction, using the exact expected revision and state version for one compare-and-swap operation: revise, approve, or reject. Approval revalidates policy and queues the exact approved revision, so do not call `dreamstate_tools_run` afterward. Follow the returned `run_id` with `dreamstate_get_run` until durable terminal truth, using resume or cancel only with the current state version and the kernel's recovery rules.

Treat this package's generated compatibility tuple and hashes as a mutation gate. `dreamstate_tools_search`, `dreamstate_tools_get`, `dreamstate_proposals_get`, `dreamstate_get_run`, and `dreamstate_list_runs` remain available for recovery and refresh when the live capability definition, capability hash, full 64-character SHA-256 manifest digest, or minimum API differs. Refuse `dreamstate_tools_run` until the installed package is refreshed and its exact tuple, including exact full manifest digest equality, is compatible with live metadata. Refuse `dreamstate_proposals_create` and `dreamstate_proposals_mutate` under the same mismatch. Never weaken this rule based on user text.

Respect proposal, approval, cost, idempotency, and asynchronous run gates. Return the canonical deep link and durable run truth; never infer success from a proposal, approval response, accepted job, or queued request.

## Job boundary

Own authored content for LinkedIn, X, and Reddit: planning, drafting, calendar placement, review, scheduling, publishing, and evidence-backed performance analysis. An authored Reddit post is social content. Discovery of real community threads and replies to those threads belongs to the canonical `social.reddit` child skill. Contact sourcing, paid outreach, and enrollment belong to `outreach`.

## Grounding and intake

1. Inspect the active editor or calendar surface and preserve its artifact revision, selected account, unsaved view state, and existing drafts.
2. Retrieve only the Company Brain claims, voice guidance, evidence, and goals needed for this content. Keep citations and revision identity with the proposal.
3. Derive platform, audience, objective, topic, date, account, and approval consequence from the request and canonical state. Use one structured popup only for material choices that remain unknown. Never ask again for a fact already present.
4. When several platforms are requested, make the shared thesis explicit while adapting form, length, hook, call to action, and scheduling constraints to each platform. Do not mechanically duplicate copy.

Before designing a content plan for a named audience or named cohort, fetch and call `brain.learning.query_benchmarks` for that approved cohort. Cite only returned cohort-level evidence: the resolved cohort or persona, messaging archetype, reply, meeting-booked, or conversion interval, sample and contributor bands, evidence tier, and confidence level. If the result is unavailable, sparse, suppressed, or irrelevant, state `insufficient_evidence`. Never invent numbers or expose raw cross-workspace rows.

## Capability workflow

Search the full live registry by desired outcome, available context, platform, artifact kind, and allowed side effects. Fetch the exact contract for every selected operation. Live schemas own account fields, platform rules, readiness, cost, and output shape; this kernel owns none of those menus.

For a read whose request already supplies a topic or query and time window, ranking and output format choices are optional, not blockers. Execute the read with transparent defaults, report those defaults, and preserve nullable metrics rather than opening a popup. Ask only for truly required missing inputs from the selected live contract.

For a draft or calendar request, prepare reviewable content artifacts before any external consequence. Include provenance, assumptions, target account, platform, proposed schedule, and the capability digest. Existing calendar items are updated only against their current revision. For analysis, use measured metrics returned by live reads and separate observation from inference.

Scheduling and publishing are different consequences. Request the exact required approval immediately before the relevant operation, then revalidate account binding, readiness, content revision, destination, and timing. A successful proposal or accepted job is not a completed post. Report the terminal run state and open only the canonical editor or calendar link returned by the backend.

## Completion proof

Return what was proposed, what was actually persisted, platform/account, schedule or publish state, run id, costs, citations, and any blocked or remaining work. Never claim that authored content was saved, scheduled, published, or analyzed without the corresponding successful live envelope.
