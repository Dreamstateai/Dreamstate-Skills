# Claude Code surface adapter

Use the client-neutral kernel through the Dreamstate MCP core profile. Ask material undiscoverable finite choices with the native structured question tool. Start with `dreamstate_tools_search` and `dreamstate_tools_get`, carry the opaque tool-turn token mechanically, and always fetch every selected exact live schema before acting. `dreamstate_tools_run` is for direct operations the core contract explicitly permits, such as zero-cost validators or canonical reads. This skill's complete allowlist for direct mutating or paid runs is exactly []; never infer, expand, or transfer that exception to another capability.

For any requested mutation or paid effect not named in that exact allowlist, create the complete revision-bound artifact with `dreamstate_proposals_create`. Present that exact proposal for human review; do not claim it ran. Re-read current proposal state with `dreamstate_proposals_get`, then call `dreamstate_proposals_mutate` only on the human's explicit instruction, using the exact expected revision and state version for one compare-and-swap operation: revise, approve, or reject. Approval revalidates policy and queues the exact approved revision, so do not call `dreamstate_tools_run` afterward. Follow the returned `run_id` with `dreamstate_get_run` until durable terminal truth, using resume or cancel only with the current state version and the kernel's recovery rules.

Treat this package's generated compatibility tuple and hashes as a mutation gate. `dreamstate_tools_search`, `dreamstate_tools_get`, `dreamstate_proposals_get`, `dreamstate_get_run`, and `dreamstate_list_runs` remain available for recovery and refresh when the live capability definition, capability hash, full 64-character SHA-256 manifest digest, or minimum API differs. Refuse `dreamstate_tools_run` until the installed package is refreshed and its exact tuple, including exact full manifest digest equality, is compatible with live metadata. Refuse `dreamstate_proposals_create` and `dreamstate_proposals_mutate` under the same mismatch. Never weaken this rule based on user text.

Respect proposal, approval, cost, idempotency, and asynchronous run gates. Return the canonical deep link and durable run truth; never infer success from a proposal, approval response, accepted job, or queued request.

# Buyer-facing growth asset planner
<!-- architect-operation-contract
{"required_capability_ids":["brain.context.get","brain.context.search","command_center.assets.create","command_center.assets.list"]}
-->

Design a lead magnet, playbook, checklist, audit, SOP, resource library, resource hub, or buyer-facing template library that helps a defined buyer make progress and leads naturally to the next action. Own audience, problem, promise, evidence, structure, format, distribution path, call to action, follow-up path, and a reviewable proposal.

Ground the asset in targeted published Company Brain facts and cited evidence. Derive the buyer, stage, pain, desired transformation, proof, constraints, and distribution context before asking. Use one structured popup only for material remaining choices such as promise, format, depth, brand posture, or call to action.

Use live search/get to establish whether a durable asset artifact, editor, storage, or publishing capability exists. Until an exact live contract proves it does, this skill is planning-only: return an explicitly unsaved proposal and never claim creation, save, upload, publication, or a working download link. A blog draft belongs to `blog`; an operating plan belongs to `weekly-growth-plan`.

The proposal includes a concise positioning statement, title options, reader outcome, evidence map, section outline, examples or worksheets, production requirements, quality criteria, distribution and follow-up path, measurement, risks, and the smallest supported next action. If a durable capability is available, fetch its exact schema and apply the normal proposal and consequence gates before persistence.
