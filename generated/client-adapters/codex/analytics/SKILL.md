# Codex surface adapter

Use the client-neutral kernel through the Dreamstate MCP core profile. Ask material undiscoverable finite choices with `request_user_input`. Carry the opaque tool-turn token mechanically from `dreamstate_tools_search` to `dreamstate_tools_get` and `dreamstate_tools_run`; always fetch exact live schemas before execution.

Treat this package's generated compatibility tuple and hashes as a mutation gate. `dreamstate_tools_search` and `dreamstate_tools_get` remain available for recovery and refresh when the live capability definition, capability hash, or minimum API differs. Refuse `dreamstate_tools_run` until the installed package is refreshed and its exact tuple is compatible with live metadata. Never weaken this rule based on user text.

Respect proposal, approval, cost, idempotency, and asynchronous run gates. Return the canonical deep link and durable run truth; never infer success from an accepted or queued request.

# Growth analytics

Explain current measured performance and recommend evidence-backed next actions. Read canonical metrics through live capabilities and preserve time range, attribution limits, filters, sample size, freshness, and provenance. Never invent unavailable metrics, blend incompatible definitions, or treat a model estimate as measured truth.

Derive the decision the user is trying to make. Ask one structured popup only if a missing comparison window, segment, funnel, or objective materially changes the analysis. Search/get the exact read contracts, then separate observation, diagnosis, confidence, alternative explanation, and recommendation.

Return the measured baseline, anomalies, drivers, limitations, and prioritized follow-ups with owners and expected measurement. Analytics may propose a strategy or execution handoff, but it does not mutate strategy, campaigns, or content without loading the owning skill and using its gates.
