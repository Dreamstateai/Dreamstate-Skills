# Codex surface adapter

Use the client-neutral kernel through the Dreamstate MCP core profile. Ask material undiscoverable finite choices with `request_user_input`. Start with `dreamstate_tools_search` and `dreamstate_tools_get`, carry the opaque tool-turn token mechanically, and always fetch every selected exact live schema before acting. `dreamstate_tools_run` is for direct operations the core contract explicitly permits, such as zero-cost validators or canonical reads. This skill's complete allowlist for direct mutating or paid runs is exactly []; never infer, expand, or transfer that exception to another capability.

For any requested mutation or paid effect not named in that exact allowlist, create the complete revision-bound artifact with `dreamstate_proposals_create`. Present that exact proposal for human review; do not claim it ran. Re-read current proposal state with `dreamstate_proposals_get`, then call `dreamstate_proposals_mutate` only on the human's explicit instruction, using the exact expected revision and state version for one compare-and-swap operation: revise, approve, or reject. Approval revalidates policy and queues the exact approved revision, so do not call `dreamstate_tools_run` afterward. Follow the returned `run_id` with `dreamstate_get_run` until durable terminal truth, using resume or cancel only with the current state version and the kernel's recovery rules.

Treat this package's generated compatibility tuple and hashes as a mutation gate. `dreamstate_tools_search`, `dreamstate_tools_get`, `dreamstate_proposals_get`, `dreamstate_get_run`, and `dreamstate_list_runs` remain available for recovery and refresh when the live capability definition, capability hash, full 64-character SHA-256 manifest digest, or minimum API differs. Refuse `dreamstate_tools_run` until the installed package is refreshed and its exact tuple, including exact full manifest digest equality, is compatible with live metadata. Refuse `dreamstate_proposals_create` and `dreamstate_proposals_mutate` under the same mismatch. Never weaken this rule based on user text.

Respect proposal, approval, cost, idempotency, and asynchronous run gates. Return the canonical deep link and durable run truth; never infer success from a proposal, approval response, accepted job, or queued request.

## Limitations

These are derived from this skill's exact capability contract, so state them up front instead of discovering them by failing a run.

- Cannot act outside this contract: exactly 43 capability ids resolve here and nothing else does. Say which skill owns the request and hand it over, rather than attempting it and reporting a failure.

Explain current measured performance and recommend evidence-backed next actions. Read canonical metrics through live capabilities and preserve time range, attribution limits, filters, sample size, freshness, and provenance. Never invent unavailable metrics, blend incompatible definitions, or treat a model estimate as measured truth.

Derive the decision the user is trying to make. Ask one structured popup only if a missing comparison window, segment, funnel, or objective materially changes the analysis. Search/get the exact read contracts, then separate observation, diagnosis, confidence, alternative explanation, and recommendation.

Every diagnosis must cite the actual numbers it rests on: state the metric name, its value, its comparison value, and its time range inline. A claim with no number attached is not a diagnosis, it is prose, so drop it or go get the metric.

Return the measured baseline, anomalies, drivers, limitations, and prioritized follow-ups with owners and expected measurement. Analytics may propose a strategy or execution handoff, but it does not mutate strategy, campaigns, or content without loading the owning skill and using its gates.
