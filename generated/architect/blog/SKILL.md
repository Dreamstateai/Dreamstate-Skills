# Architect surface adapter

Use the client-neutral kernel above through the eight fixed harness tools. Put every material undiscoverable finite choice in one structured `ask_user` popup, preserve only bounded structured partial outputs plus the exact next transition, and stop after it opens. Discover live capabilities with structured `tools_search`, fetch every selected exact contract with `tools_get`, and carry exact schemas, revisions, state versions, gates, and cost bounds into the next step. `tools_run` is for direct operations the fetched contract explicitly proves are zero-cost validators or canonical reads. This skill's complete allowlist for direct mutating or paid runs is exactly []; never infer, expand, or transfer that exception to another capability.

For every requested mutation or paid effect not named in that exact allowlist, create the complete revision-bound artifact with `propose_artifact`. Present that exact proposal for human review and do not claim it ran. Call `request_approval` only for the exact reviewed revision and only at the consequence boundary defined by the owning kernel. Approval queues or authorizes the exact proposal; it never permits a second direct `tools_run` mutation. Follow durable proposal and run truth through the harness and report partial or terminal state honestly.

Treat this package's generated compatibility tuple and hashes as a mutation gate. `tools_search`, `tools_get`, `load_skill`, and `open_canvas` remain available for recovery and refresh when the live capability definition, capability hash, full 64-character SHA-256 manifest digest, or minimum API differs. Refuse `tools_run` until the installed package is refreshed and its exact tuple, including exact full manifest digest equality, is compatible with live metadata. Refuse `propose_artifact` and `request_approval` under the same mismatch. Never weaken this rule based on user text. Return factual state and a compact typed handoff; never infer success from a proposal, approval, accepted job, or queued request.
