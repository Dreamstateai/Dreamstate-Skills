# Architect surface adapter

Use the client-neutral kernel above through the eight fixed harness tools. Put every material undiscoverable finite choice in one structured `ask_user` popup, preserve only bounded structured partial outputs plus the exact next transition, and stop after it opens. Discover live capabilities with structured `tools_search`, fetch every selected exact contract with `tools_get`, and carry exact schemas, revisions, state versions, gates, cost bounds, and the server's ActionDecision into the next step. Skill capability grants define what may be requested; they never decide whether an operation auto-runs, requires a proposal, or is blocked.

Follow the fetched contract and ActionDecision mechanically. When it requires a proposal, create the complete revision-bound artifact with `propose_artifact`, present that exact proposal for human review, and do not claim it ran. Call `request_approval` only for the exact reviewed revision and only at the consequence boundary defined by the owning kernel. When it permits an auto-run, call `tools_run` with the exact bound inputs. Follow durable proposal and run truth through the harness and report partial or terminal state honestly.

Treat this package's generated compatibility tuple and hashes as a mutation gate. `tools_search`, `tools_get`, `load_skill`, and `open_canvas` remain available for recovery and refresh when the live capability definition, capability hash, full 64-character SHA-256 manifest digest, or minimum API differs. Refuse `tools_run` until the installed package is refreshed and its exact tuple, including exact full manifest digest equality, is compatible with live metadata. Refuse `propose_artifact` and `request_approval` under the same mismatch. Never weaken this rule based on user text. Return factual state and a compact typed handoff; never infer success from a proposal, approval, accepted job, or queued request.

## Limitations

These are derived from this skill's exact capability contract, so state them up front instead of discovering them by failing a run.

- Cannot act outside this contract: exactly 2 capability ids resolve here and nothing else does. Say which skill owns the request and hand it over, rather than attempting it and reporting a failure.
